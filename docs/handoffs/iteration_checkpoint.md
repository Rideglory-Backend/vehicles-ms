# Iteration checkpoint (in-flight)

**Purpose:** Human-readable **resume trail**. After **each** phase completes, update this file in the same session as `workflow/state.json` → `phase_complete`. Powers quick orientation for `/resume-iter` when a run stops mid-way (tokens, crash, context limit).

**Machine-readable file trail:** `workflow/artifact_log.json` — agents append paths via `scripts/log_artifact.py` so resumes see every generated/changed file, including mid-phase.

**Not the same as** `docs/ITERATION_HISTORY.md` — that file is **append-only when an iteration fully closes** (`po_close`), not after every agent.

## Status: idle

No active iteration checkpoint. Run **`/iter N`** or **`/resume-iter`** to continue work.

When an iteration closes, the PO overwrites this section and sets **Last closed** below.
